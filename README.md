# Simple-Platformer
A simple platformer made using pygame and custom made assets. This short game, has three maps with varying dificulties. This game is player vs environment, so the use of spikes are there to provide an obstacle.
The main feature of this game was the use of scrolling through the manipulation of every asset position. This lets the player move throughout the map, uncovering new parts, i.e. not having the whole map rendered on
the screen at once.
